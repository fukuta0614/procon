hey guys bobby here

today we're going to take a look at how

to prepare for the oecp

labs and what the whole journey actually

means

um starting right off the bat

my first point would be allocating as m

as much time as you can for the for the

whole preparation thing

so in my case i was i was a student

when i when i started the preparation so

i didn't really have in

that much time but i guess if you

already if you're already working or

you already have a family and stuff like

that it's even worse

with that time so i would say that okay

being able to allocate as much as one to

two hours a day

prior to let's say for a period of like

three months before starting the actual

osp labs

would be critical not only because

um you don't really know what to expect

but

more because you really have

you really need to go through all of the

you know required steps

to actually you know not waste your time

and not waste your money uh the second

point

would be knowing your level

i mean approximately level from

beforehand so what i mean by approximate

level

well you know not everybody's a

professional from

from the get-go right i mean i i don't

think anybody is

so you know knowing your level from

beforehand is essential so you know

how much time you actually have to

dedicate and how much on what other

things you have you actually have to

improve right

and how i actually settled

my level so to say before starting the

icp labs was

i simply went to hack the box and

boomhub

and tried to do as many boxes as i could

like the easy and the medium levels

without any hints whatsoever right

because this is actually very important

the there is like a hint trap where you

do

you know you do the retry retired boxes

or like the old boxes

and you solve them buddy but you solve

them with the hints

and that's not really effective i mean

it is to some degree but

you can have you kind of have to be very

i mean there's like a very slight very

fragile line between

a uh you know you actually solving the

boxes on yourself or you're actually

solving

only 10 of the box and the rest of the

nine percent is

hints so the third point would be uh

solving more than a half of the dj news

obviously b boxes laced so i'll leave a

link in the description

with all the boxes that are like kind of

they come recommended for the osp and

some of them actually look very a lot

like the

osp labs so you know solving

um yeah solving half of them

without yeah let's say without hints or

with very little hints would actually

mean that you're

i would say good enough yeah good enough

to actually

start the osp labs and you know go

confidently throughout it

and like be very confident that you will

be able to pass it

right so this this will be the third

point the fourth point

would be being comfortable with stack

based uh buffer overflows

right uh i was actually very scared at

first as

i guess many more of you are and the

thing is that they're not actually that

hard so

after we like and get to understand some

tricks

uh it's really easy and like they're

very easy to follow they have a really

logic step-by-step uh let's say walk

through

i was very lucky to be honest with i

have some colleagues in my uh

cyber security team shout out to htsp

um and they really helped me throughout

the whole osp journey and especially on

the stack base overflows because i

haven't had any experience beforehand

whatsoever

right um i'll leave a link i also leave

a link with the

uh with some tips on how to prepare for

it like some step-by-step

guides uh why is it that important to

prepare for the stack based overflow

you may ask well

the thing is that the boxes the the the

i mean

the box in the doing the ocp exam itself

is worth 25 points so you basically need

70 out of 100 to pass right so just

25 is a lot of is a lot of points for

for such an exam

and it's actually really easy to do

you'll yeah you'll see all right so the

fifth

and probably the most important point

after all is

knowing how to properly and

you know neatly take notes and what i

mean by that well personally

i use notion for note-taking and

it's really easy and really convenient

because i can simply

create new pages for the for let's say

for the oscp

land boxes and i could easily you can

easily create pages maintain them manage

them and like

tag them differently uh for example

in my case i simply created a table when

i was doing the tj knows list

i created a table where i would tag

each box whether they were linux whether

they were

windows whether whether they were

something else

and also i think most importantly i

would tag

the vulnerability and the tools that

i've used

right so taking notes both of the

vulnerabilities

that a certain paranormal machine had

and also the tools that we've used for

for it

are i mean these are the the most

important

things to take note of right because it

will be in the case of oh

i have this i don't know active

directory

vulnerable machine but i don't actually

know what tools i've previously used

right so

you go notion you create like the table

you have a box

and you you say oh this this was this

was active directory windows

i don't know what kind of version and

i've used this this and this and that

right so you'll be very convenient and

you could search very easily

even during the exam but yeah so that

was it guys uh

thank you so much for your attention i

hope this

this video really helped you uh

preparing for up you know oscp labs

i'll also record one for you know

actually

preparing for the oasis exam itself

because that's a little bit more

different

uh but this should you know with

with the tips here you should i'm very

confident that you will

be more than prepared for for starting

the osp

labs themselves so yeah good luck on

that

and i'll see you in the next video bye
