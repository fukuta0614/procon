  Zip archive file size:                     21697 (00000000000054C1h)
  Actual end-cent-dir record offset:         21675 (00000000000054ABh)
  Expected end-cent-dir record offset:       21675 (00000000000054ABh)
  (based on the length of the central directory and its expected offset)

  This zipfile constitutes the sole disk of a single-part archive; its
  central directory contains 16 entries.
  The central directory is 1078 (0000000000000436h) bytes long,
  and its (expected) offset in bytes from the beginning of the zipfile
  is 20597 (0000000000005075h).
